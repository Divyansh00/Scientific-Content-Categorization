       "'dietary patterns are suggested to be an important environmental risk factor for cancer [1]. inorganic phosphate (pi) is a dietary constituent well-known for its role in skeletal mineralization, and normal levels of pi are essential to maintain normal cellular function [2]. recent experimental studies in rodents indicated that pi may act as an active regulator of growth rather than a merely compulsory element in cellular homeostasis. elevated levels of serum pi were found to modify gene expression as well as protein translation and affect the rate of cell proliferation in vitro [3, 4]. moreover, a high pi diet has been reported to result in a significantly increased development of lung and skin cancers, as well as perturbed normal brain growth in animal studies [5–7], which denoted the potential link between pi and carcinogenesis in humans. however, to our knowledge there are no observational studies describing the association between pi and cancer risk in humans. besides being naturally present in raw food including meats, fish, eggs, dairy products and vegetables, pi is also found as an additive in processed food such as hamburgers and pizza, and as phosphoric acid in soda beverages [8]. mostly, this pi content is not listed as an ingredient per se, and it was reported that this ‘hidden’ pi content of food with pi-containing additives is nearly 70% higher than in food without additives [9]. in the human body pi is known to be mainly regulated by a set of hormonal and metabolic factors which tightly control calcium homeostasis, i.e. vitamin d and parathyroid hormone (pth), and a recently identified pi-regulating hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (fgf-23). however, intestinal absorption of pi is efficient and minimally regulated [2, 10], so that high pi supplementation results in markedly elevated levels of serum pi [11, 12]. additionally, abnormal pi levels are also a common feature of various metabolic diseases including diabetes and rickets [13, 14]. considering the emerging experimental evidence linking pi and cancer, it is of interest to explore this relation in an observational population-based setting. the swedish apolipoprotein mortality risk (amoris) database has been described in detail elsewhere [15–17]. briefly, this database is based on the linkage of the central automation laboratory (calab) database (1985–1996) to various swedish national registries, including the national cancer register. the calab database includes data from 351,487 male and 338,101 female individuals having clinical laboratory testing as part of a general health check-up or outpatients referred for laboratory testing. no individuals were inpatients at the time their blood samples were taken. this study complied with the declaration of helsinki, and the ethics review board of the karolinska institutet approved the study (diary number: 2010/1047-31/1). we selected all participants aged 20 or older with baseline measurements of serum pi, calcium (mmol/l), alkaline phosphatase (mmol/l), glucose (mmol/l) and creatinine (μmol/l) (n = 397,292). all participants were free from cancer at time of entry and none were diagnosed with cancer or died within three months after study entry. follow-up time was defined as the time from measurement until date of cancer diagnosis, emigration, death, or study closing date (31st of december 2002), whichever occurred first. the calab database also contained information on age, season at time of measurement, and fasting status. diagnosis of cancer were obtained from the national cancer register and classified based on the international classification of diseases, seventh revision (icd-7; codes for specific cancer sites are presented in tables). socioeconomic status (ses) was taken from the consecutive swedish censuses during 1970–1990 and is based on occupational groups and classifies gainfully employed subjects into manual workers and non-manual employees, below designated as blue-collar and white-col'"

       "'vulvar squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer form with increasing incidence rate and few treatment options. wee1 is a central regulator of the g2/m dna-damage checkpoint, and has in previous studies been described as a prognostic biomarker and a potential target for therapy in other cancer forms. in the present study we analyzed the expression of wee1 in a panel of 297 vulvar tumors by immunohistochemistry. furthermore, sirna transfections were carried out in two vulvar cancer cell lines (sw-954 and cal-39) in order to study the effect on cell cycle distribution (flow cytometry) and proteins (western blot) involved in dna damage response and apoptosis. wee1 kinase is increased in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, as compared to expression in normal epithelium, and a high wee1 expression is associated with markers of malignancy, such as lymph node metastasis and poor differentiation. our in vitro results showed that sirna mediated wee1 silencing only led to a modest reduction in viability, when examined in vulvar cancer cell lines. nonetheless, a marked increase in dna damages, as assessed by augmented levels of γ-h2ax, was observed in both cell lines in the absence of wee1. our results suggest that wee1 may be involved in the progression of vulvar carcinomas. based on our in vitro results, wee1 is unlikely to function as a target for mono-treatment of these patients.'"
